### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd Farmer_assistant_bot
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 3: Set Up Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
# Required
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here

# Optional (for enhanced functionality)
TAVILY_API_KEY=your_tavily_api_key_here
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=path_to_google_cloud_credentials.json
```

### Step 4: Google Cloud Setup (Optional)
For enhanced speech and translation features:

1. Create a Google Cloud Project
2. Enable the following APIs:
   - Cloud Speech-to-Text API
   - Cloud Translation API
